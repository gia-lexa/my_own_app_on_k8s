# README

This is a multi-service Ruby application, with each service contained in its own Docker image and deployed across Kubernetes. The purpose of this repo is to provide myself a no-stakes means of practicing Kubernetes concepts. The "services" are intentionally, somewhat ridiculously, simple in order to keep the focus on the Kubernetes configuration. This work is ongoing and an opportunity to experiment and break things. 

More details to be added soon...
