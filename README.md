# README

- This is a multi-service Ruby application, with each service contained in its own Docker image and deployed across Kubernetes. 

- The purpose of this repo is to provide myself a no-stakes means of repeating and experimenting with Kubernetes concepts. 

- The "services" are intentionally, somewhat ridiculously, simple in order to keep the focus on the Kubernetes configuration. 

- This work is ongoing, more details to be added soon...
